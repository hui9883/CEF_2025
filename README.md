First run **UK_min_ff_test.py** file, which contains four paths, corresponding to four scenarios, you can independently choose to run the scenarios, if you need to run all of them, please uncomment and run one by one.

After UK_min_ff_test.py finishes running, a series of outputs will be saved in the corresponding paths, and **mef_energy_analysis_new.py** can be used for further analysis.

The **data** folder stores the raw data needed to run the code.

The **functions** folder contains the functions to be called.
